            Below are all the necessary details, rules, and guidelines for the competitional aspect of MOAA 2023.

          <h2 class="centerThis">General Information</h2>
          <p class="align-left">
            The 2023 competition will be held on Saturday, October 7, and consist of three rounds. Teams will consist of 1 to 4 students. Each round will be
            available during a specific time block during the day. Teams can compete in one of two divisions: virtually or in-person (see FAQ for details).
            Further details about contest logistics will be announced closer to the competition date.
            The problems on each round can be solved using only middle school mathematical techniques and
            every problem is computationally feasible without calculators. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, the use of
            any external source or aid, including calculators, dictionaries, notes, coaches, or proctors, is prohibited.
            Score will be calculated using each question’s point value, which is written next to the question number.
          </p>
          <h3>Speed Round</h3>
          <p class="align-left">
            An individual competition, the Speed Round is a 10 question test to be completed in 20 minutes. All answers are non-negative integers at most 1,000,000.
          </p>
          <h3>Accuracy Round</h3>
          <p class="align-left">
            An individual competition, the Accuracy Round is a 10 question test to be completed in 45 minutes. All answers are non-negative integers at most 1,000,000.
          </p>
          <h3>Team Round</h3>
          <p class="align-left">
            A team competition, the Team Round is a 15 question test to be completed in 40 minutes. All answers are non-negative integers at most 1,000,000.
          </p>
          <h3>Gunga Bowl</h3>
          <p class="align-left">
            Inspired by the Harvard MIT Mathematics Tournament's Guts Round, the Gunga Bowl is a fast-paced race between teams - with a live scoreboard and timer. The Gunga Bowl is composed of 9 rounds of 3 problems each, to be completed in 60 minutes. All answers are non-negative integers.

          <h2 class="centerThis">Virtual Competition Information</h2>
          <p class="align-left">
            All of the virtual competition itenerary will take place on Zoom and Discord platforms. All competitors will log into a general Zoom link during registration (link will be provided to competitors prior to the competition), and competitors will remain on the 
            same Zoom link throughout the remainder of the day (with exception of lunch). A breakout room will be open in the Zoom during competition hours for technology/logistical help. Otherwise, competitors will be muted throughout the duration of the Speed and Accuracy rounds. For 
            the Team and Gunga Bowl rounds, teams will be split into breakout rooms and will be able to discuss the questions. Only the Captain will be able to submit answers from the MOAA Portal (found on the website) via Qualtrics survey for scoring.
            For all rounds, Qualtrics survey will be used for answer submission. A countdown timer will be present in the Zoom room so competitors know exactly how much time remains in the round. Participants MUST submit all answers by the end of the countdown. 
            The same Zoom link will be used to livestream any speaker sessions open to students. A separate link (sent to parents only) will be available for the parent speaker session. For more details, see the FAQ section or email director@andovermathopen.com.

            <h2 class="centerThis">Rules and Guidelines</h2>
            <p class="align-left">Please respect and obey the following guidelines; doing so will make the contest experience better for everyone!</p>
            <h3>In-Competition Rules</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                No mathematical texts, notes, or online resources of any kind are permitted.
                Rely on your brain and those of your teammates!
              </li>
              <li>
                Compasses, protractors, rulers, straightedges, graph paper, blank scratch paper, and writing implements
                are generally permitted, so long as they are not designed to give an unfair advantage.
              </li>
              <li>
                No computational aids (including but not limited to calculators, phones, calculator watches, and
                computer programs) are permitted on any portion of the MOAA unless explicitly authorized by the MOAA team.
              </li>
              <li>
                All answers for any question on any round will be non-negative integers between 0 and 1,000,000, inclusive.
              </li>
              <li>
                Individuals may only help or receive help from members of their team — consulting any other
                individual is grounds for disqualification.
              </li>
              <li>
                Competition staff may not answer any questions about the contest problems until the conclusion of the MOAA.
                As such, we will not be able to explain any of the mathematical terminology on the MOAA to
                teams until the conclusion of the contest.
              </li>
              <li>
                Any questions or requests for clarification regarding the above should be forwarded
                to <a href="mailto: director@andovermathopen.com">director@andovermathopen.com</a>. Decisions made by the MOAA team are final and may not be appealed.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>General Guidelines</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Integrity is of the utmost importance in any competitive event. Any individual or team discovered to be providing or
                receiving unauthorized aid by any means on any portion of the competition will be penalized at the discretion of the
                MOAA team.
              </li>
              <li>
                Any individual that interferes with or jeopardizes the fairness of the competition - including the grading and
                awarding process - may be disqualified. Any other participants affiliated with the individuals, such as their
                teammates, may also be disqualified.
              </li>
              <li>
                Any individual that jeopardizes the physical or mental wellness of any other competitor may be removed from
                the competition at the discretion of the MOAA team.
              </li>
              <li>
                We cannot be responsible for any contest-day contingencies that prevent an individual or team from competing
                at full capacity. All proposed accommodations must be explicitly communicated to the MOAA team, in writing,
                by October 1st.
              </li>
              <li>
                Have fun!
